Bicycle Accidents in Great Britain Data Mining Project

Nicolas Mavromatis

# Project Description and Summary: 

This is a data mining analysis of bicycle accidents in Great Britain from 1970-2018. This study assessed relationships using chi squared tests between different attributes and accident severity, resulting in slight, serious, or fatal accidents. It also used frequency statistics to understand data spread. 

The questions posed were, is there a specific age range or gender most associated with severe biking accidents? Do certain speed limit zones correlate with high numbers of severe accidents? Are certain times of day most associated with severe accidents? Could this be explained by brightness? Finally, do certain road conditions associate with severe accidents? 

The results were that 80% of all accident victims were male, and were more likely to be involved in fatal accidents than females. Bicyclists 65 years and older were far more likely to be involved in a serious or fatal accident. Most accidents occurred in locations with the speed limit around 30 mph, although in 70 mph locations, accidents were much more likely to be fatal. Fatal accidents were much more common during 12:00 AM-8:00 AM and 7:45 PM-12:00 AM, with the vast majority of accidents happened under conditions of darkness. Most accidents occurred in dry conditions, but wet conditions were more slightly more likely to result in fatalities. 

# Application:

Prediction of conditions that associate with bike accidents and education of the general public are the main applications of the study. Bikers above 65 years should be very cautious biking, and perhaps refrain from biking in busy areas. Males should be aware they are more likely to be involved in an accident, although this may be due simply to a great majority of bikers being male. Bikers should avoid the roads during wet conditions, as they are more likely to result in fatalities. They should also avoid biking during late dark hours where visibility is reduced. Bikers armed with this knowledge may be able to avoid the potential for an accident by modifying their habits. Perhaps bicycle safety classes relaying this information could decrease the number of accidents.
